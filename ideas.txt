Commands:

	/best <words>
		Ads those words to the tgen best file

	/timezone
	/tz
		Changes the timezone, ie: "/tz -8" for PST

Other Ideas:

	- use icons instead of or as well as (idle X minutes)
	- go idle after not having the window focused for a minute or something
	- mobile version for blackberry/iphone
	- timezone is off (have javascript send?)
	- pull in Twitter streams dynamically

	+ up arrow scrolls through message history
	+ upload files with a button
	+ remember names with cookies
	+ themes (remember with cookies)

Bugs:
	- entered the room not working
	- left the room not working
	- [tgen 2] should be converted on-the-fly (right now is dynamically randomized)
